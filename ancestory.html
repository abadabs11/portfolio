<h3 class="red">Overview</h3>
At its core, Ancestory was a study of visual design and craft. I created a system of design elements that could be used to build story books that tell the tale of your ancestry, one ancestor at a time. Using two layers of typography, the books tell the story twice over, featuring a slimmed down narrative for children to read. The project resolved itself in several sets of handmade books, including a style guide, and a proposal for the integration of Ancestory with popular genealogy databases like <a class="yellow">ancestry.com</a>.

<h3 class="red">Where did I come from?</h3>
  Who hasn't dwelled on this question?
  <br><br>
  The inherent drive to connect our story with the broader narratives of our heritage in order to learn more about our present, and where we are going, is the reason companies like ancestry.com continue to thrive. However, these companies require users to spend untold amounts of time and energy stringing together bits of history, while still not fully providing them with a relatable picture of their family’s past. More importantly, they do not properly offer a platform for users to translate the story of their ancestors from the internet to a realm where the history will continue to be passed on to future generations.

<h3 class="red">How Ancestory Begain</h3>
  Growing up I never knew anything about my family’s history beyond my great grandparent’s generation. I had relatives throughout northern New England, some even living as far south as the exotic land of New Jersey. But that’s where the trail ended. Until my uncle started fully digging into answering that question for our family: where did we come from? Through he extensive research (we’re talking months of digging) he began finding connecting threads from our ancestors. 
  <br><br>
  And ya know what? My family is pretty cool.
  <br><br>
  Notable direct ancestors include the first witch to be executed in America, a signer of the Mayflower compact, and a famous American artist who also happened to be BFF’s with Ben Franklin, I found out that us Hanright’s aren’t just mutts but a lineage to be proud of.

<h3 class="red">Identifying the Gap</h3>
  While ancestry.com was a terrific platform for exploring the trail of our heritage, and my Uncle’s frequent emails to the family got everyone increasingly excited, the magic quickly died out. These snippets of our heritage were so deeply rooted in disparate stories, locked behind a not-so-cheap website, and as such our story was easily forgotten. If these stories are not presented in a format that can be passed down to future generations, they become inaccessible, and it will not take long for family members to lose the thread of their family’s story and once again ask the question “where did I come from”.

<h3 class="red">Ancestory was Born</h3>
  While reflecting on why I was interested in the topic of my ancestry, I discovered that the most exciting aspects are the stories that are told through the journeys and lives of specific ancestors, not just family trees full of birth and death dates. The tragedies and triumphs of individuals are often more compelling than the standard family information available through government records, and therefore they should form the basis of any captivating presentation of a person’s ancestry. 
  <br><br>
  Throughout the project I worked to develop a method by which to tell these stories that was standardized enough to fit with anyone's family, while still being beautiful, unique pieces of design. Focusing on the design and craft of these objects was important to ensure they would be passed from generation to generation, and not simply forgotten, keeping the family’s story alive.

<br>

<h3 class="red">Conclusion</h3>
This project furthered my love for print design while teaching me the importance of constantly being aware of your audience and their needs. At the beginning of the project I simply wanted to create a series of zines using stories from my family's ancestry as the content. I quickly realized that while this idea may interest me, it is not scaleable or useful to anyone outside of my family. In addition to honing my craft, this project helped me learn that there is really no point in designing simply for the sake of design, that overindulgence of my craft must be tempered by functionality.
