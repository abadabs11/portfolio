    <h2 class="teal">About Me</h2>
    I was always the kid who wanted to do *everything*.  Growing up that meant taking on multiple instruments, playing sports every season, and joining far more clubs than was necessary. Someone should’ve stopped me. But, as I got older, I narrowed my focus (giving up saxophone and field hockey and Latin Club along the way.)
<br><br>
    Instead, beginning at the end of high school I became fully engulfed in the world of design. Though you see, one of the things that has always enticed me about design is that it comes in so many shapes and sizes. So, naturally over the years I have found myself wanting to weave my way back into *everything*.
<br><br>
    In an industry where jargon rules, I’d say you can call me a full stack designer. While my roots began with a fascination in <a target="blank" class="red">print design</a>, my interests quickly evolved to include <a target="blank" class="red">UI design</a>, <a target="blank" class="red">front end development</a>, <a target="blank" class="red">leadership</a>, and <a target="blank" class="red">strategy</a> (marketing, UX & business).
<br><br>
    Now I’m looking for people who share the same enthusiasm for continuously learning, creating, and building better things. (Preferably things that do a bit more than deliver moustache supplies to millennials. Just an example…) If you think you have a project that fits, let’s get coffee (or virtual coffee?) and I promise I’ll keep it to 3 bad jokes, max.
<br><br>

    <h2 class="teal">About Me TL;DR</h2>
    Sarcastic as hell, hard working to a fault, always looking for something awesome to get my hands on.
<br><br>

    <h2 class="teal">About Me NLE;IWM*</h2>
    Check out this reflection I wrote on how I got to where I am in this crazy ever evolving world of design.
